# PROG1935-In class task 5
## Food facts with react router

The food facts app allows you to search for a category of food, and visit the detail about that food. Task 5 is to make 2 routes with react router. 1 search and 1 detail. The search page takes a query parameter like `s=jam`. The detail page takes a query parameter like `code=1234`. You will need to use the useSearchParam hook to consume these parameters.
